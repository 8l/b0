B0 Compiler Package
(c) Darran Kartaschew 2000-2008

Released under a BSD licence.

This package contains the b0 compiler and basic libraries needed
to produce GNU\Linux 64bit (x86_64), FreeBSD 64bit, Solaris 11 x64
or Windows x64 based applications. The compiler must be compiled 
from source code before it can be used.

(A 32bit version for i386 systems can also be built, by either
running 'make b0-ia32', 'build i386' or uncommenting '#define i386'
in ./src/b0.c).

Pre-requisites:
b0 only requires gcc 3.x, glibc (Development packages) and FASM. Most
GNU/Linux distro's have these installed by default. GNU Make is 
also needed to compile the compilers source, but you can build
it manually if you so desire.

For Windows XP x64 or Windows Vista x64, you'll need VC++ 2003,
VC++ 2008 or VC++ 2005 Express Edn and FASM. Both VC++ 2003, 
VC++ 2008 and VC++ 2005 Express Edn are available at no cost from 
MS for non-commercial purposes. When obtaining VC++ 2005 Express Edn, 
be sure to also download the latest Windows SDK to obtain the latest 
API documentation.

To install (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris):
>$ make linux 
>$ gmake solaris
>$ gmake freebsd
>$ su -c "make install"
>$ make clean

To install (Windows):
> build
> build install
> build clean

Then add the environment variable B0_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/b0
eg.
>$ SET B0_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/b0

or alternatively within ~/.profile add:

export B0_INCLUDE="/usr/local/include/b0"

and for Windows:
1. Right-click 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'
2. Select 'Advanced' Tab and 'Environment Variables'
3. Add it in under 'User'.

To Uninstall (as root):
># make uninstall for Linux
># gmake uninstall for FreeBSD/Solaris
># build uninstall for Windows

Once installed, runtime configuration can be viewed by
>$ man b0

A pdf manual can be built, however requires html2ps and Ghostscript
to be installed, and therefore is not created by default. 
Note: The manual is provided as html by default, and is found in the
./doc directory. To make a pdf version of the user manual type
>$ make docs

The file 'b0.pdf' will be created, which can be viewed with any pdf 
viewer. 

Several examples for Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and Windows x64 can be
found in the ./examples directory.
